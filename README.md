A simple to-do list made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Tasks can be created and deleted, assigned due dates, or
put into "projects." Additionally, the website uses local-
storage: information is saved between reloads/tab closes.

The Javascript is bloated IMO- I'll refactor it/add new 
features once I become more familliar with the language/
coding in general.
